# test_printf

A Test set for ft_printf project at Hive Helsinki.

To run the test, clone the repositories to any where in your home directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/Caruychen/test_printf.git
```
Modify the Makefile's `PRINTF_DIR` variable with the directory path to your ft_printf directory.

finally, run the tests by execuding the `run.sh` script.

It should compile and run, and start executing the tests. The output will be either [OK] or [NOT OK] depending on the results. The tests diff the outputs of the standard C printf against your ft_printf

The results will be immediately output to your terminal
